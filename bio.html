			I am currently a senior Cognitive and Brain Sciences major at Tufts University, where I work in the Memory and Cognition lab under <a href="https://ase.tufts.edu/psychology/people/chechile/" target="_blank">Professor Richard Chechile</a>, as well as rowing for the <a href="http://gotuftsjumbos.com/sports/mcrew/index" target="_blank">Tufts Men's Varsity Crew team</a>. I am also minoring in Computer Science.

			I grew up in Brunswick, ME, and spent much of my childhood in the outdoors enjoying many of the same things I enjoy today: hiking, camping, swimming, sailing, skiing, and exploring. However, I was also an incorrigible bookworm as a child, and had to be told frequently by my parents to stop reading so that I could get enough sleep before school the next day. I would frequently get so excited about the stories I read that I would have to run to my parents, friends, or anyone else who would listen to tell them about all the wonderful things that had happened.
		</p>
		<p>
			While my taste in fiction and methods of exploring the outdoors have developed over the years, I have retained the same level of enthusiasm to explore and understand the external world of nature and the numerous internal worlds of stories, and strive to bring that same curiosity and pursuit of knowledge to a career.
